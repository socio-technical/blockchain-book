vice versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a
particular form, so that only those for whom it is intended can read
and process it. Cryptography not only protects data from theft or
alteration, it can also be used for user authentication.

| ICO                | An initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of   |
|                    | crowdfunding centred around cryptocurrency,    |
|                    | which can be a source of capital for start-up  |
|                    | companies. In an ICO, some quantity of the     |
|                    | crowdfunded cryptocurrency is preallocated to  |
|                    | investors in the form of 'tokens', in          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin
or Ethereum. These tokens become functional units of currency if or
when the ICO's funding goal is met, and the project launches.
